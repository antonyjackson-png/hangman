# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Before playing the game, the referee should provide a list of words, word_list. In the example provided in the script, there are five fruits. Replace the list provided.

The game is started by calling the play_game function with word_list provided as a single argument.


The final model is self-contained in milestone_5.py
